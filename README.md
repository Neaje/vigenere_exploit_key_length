# vigenere_exploit_key_length
Exploitation of vigenere encryption with known key length

# How to use 
There is an english_freq variable, which means that the decrypted text must be in English. If you want to decipher a text in another language, you just have to change the letter frequency table

To launch the program you must execute the following command:

```bash
python3 exploit.py <key_length> <filename>
```

The decrypted text and the estimated key will appear in standard output

# Exemple of use 

I provided an example file with key length 5

```bash
python3 exploit.py 5 vigenere_01_ciphertext.txt
Estimated Key: house

# Limitations 

The smaller the text, the more complicated the key estimation is, this is due to letter frequencies being distorted in small sentences.
